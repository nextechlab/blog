What happens when a bunch of crazy programmers team up to create something special and teach it to the whole world?
Well, this blog.

We are a student run lab working in SRM University, Chennai, working on Artificial Intelligence, Mixed reality and IOT.
Our members are probably the coolest people you will ever meet.

You've ever dreamt of having an Artificially Intelligent system?
We build it.
